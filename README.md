# OOP_EX2

we built a package protected classes for vertecies and edges.
the Graph class had a private edges and vertecies atrabutes.
It made sure they are "syncronised" with one another.
this data structures are semi-dynamic and allow to preforme basic operation
required for the project in constant or logorithmic time.
